* [Assignment 2: Playing with Images](##Playing with Images)

## CPP Basics
This module contains the solutions to the questions for the first Assignment present in separate directories of their own. Each question is attempted in a `main.cpp` file and a corresponding `main.exe` output file and a screenshot of the output is present.

## Playing with Images
Each question of this module contains drawing on images(except for the last one which contains rotation of images). There is an image of a tower which is provided in order to check the output as well. To execute the output file, use the following command.
```bash
./foo <image-path>
```

For ease of access you can also use the image already provided in the "Images" directory.
```bash
./foo ../Images/tower.jpeg
```
