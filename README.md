# Pixels_Assignments

Contains the Assignments for Pixels Workshops,completed by AJ
* [Assignment 1: CPP Basics](#cpp-Basics)
* [Assignment 2: Playing with Images](#playing-with-images)
* [Assignment 3: Convolutions](#convolutions)

## CPP Basics
This module contains the solutions to the questions for the first Assignment present in separate directories of their own. Each question is attempted in a `main.cpp` file and a corresponding `main.exe` output file and a screenshot of the output is present.

## Playing with Images
Each question of this module contains drawing on images(except for the last one which contains rotation of images). There is an image of a tower which is provided in order to check the output as well. To execute the output file, use the following command.
```bash
./foo <image-path>
```

For ease of access you can also use the image already provided in the "Images" directory.
```bash
./foo ../Images/tower.jpeg
```
## Convolutions
This module contains a main program `convolve.cpp` which takes the filepath of the image to be convolved and asks the user for an odd Kernel.
```bash
./convolve <image-path>
```

For ease of access you can also use the image already provided in the "Images" directory.
```bash
./convolve Images/tower.jpeg
```
